		<p>The Biden Administration is currently considering granting approval to the opening of 5 new oil drilling sites on the Northern Alaskan Slope.</p>

		<p>According to Evening Standard, the operation could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>

		<p>The Washington Post asserts it would produce 9.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, and potentially encroach on vital habitats for many animals such as caribou.</p>

		<p>This is a direct violation of Biden's promise to divest from fossil fuels and support clean energy, and a grave threat to the environment.</p>
